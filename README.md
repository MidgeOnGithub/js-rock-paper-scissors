## The First Odin on Rails JS [Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)
This project is meant to demonstrate basic understanding of Javascript, including basic syntax, conditionals, and functions.

### Reflections
Beyond the HTML and browser use in testing, the coding for this project felt similar to coding in C, with only a few JS-specific syntaxes and tricks that wouldn't work in a C-like language. My previous experiences with C, C++, and Rust made this a relatively smooth and quick project. My biggest concern is if the code is idiomatic; I will be able to better evaluate this as I learn more JavaScript.
