## The First Odin on Rails JS [Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)
The first instruction set demands use of the console and `prompt()` rather than a GUI, and is meant to demonstrate basic understanding of Javascript, including basic syntax, conditionals, and functions. The second instruction asks to revisit the project and remove use of the console and instead implement a GUI with buttons and proper event listening to handle the games in matches of 5.

### Reflections
Beyond the HTML and browser use in testing, the coding for this project felt similar to coding in C, with only a few JS-specific syntaxes and tricks that wouldn't work in a C-like language. My previous experiences with C, C++, and Rust made this a relatively smooth and quick project.

My biggest concern was if the code was idiomatic; I asked in The Odin Project's Discord server and was given positive feedback, with notes about the use of prefix `++` instead of postfix. My C/C++ experiences would dictate that I use the prefix operator as I did, but ultimately, if I were working in a company using JS, I would tend to match their codebase's standard (unless they are keen on adjusting this everywhere, knowing it could break expected behavior if not done carefully).
